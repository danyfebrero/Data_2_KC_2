Welcome to Knowledge Check 2!

We're going to clean some data today. I would guess about 70% of data science is cleaning and wrangling data, so we want to make sure you can do it. I haven't looked through this data set at all, so we'll see if we can find some issues to clean up. 
Here's what you need to do to complete the knowledge check:
  Make a .py (or .ipynb) file that contains the following (your choice of editor does not matter!) and do the following:
    find and access a data set in any way you want. You can use an API, a CSV, anything.
    Fix TWO issues with the data set using techniques you've learned in class. Here are some common fixes:
      Remove null values
      Fill in null values with 0's or blanks
      fill in blanks
      fix character strings that aren't formatted correctly (you could use regex for this)
      correct column names if they're misnamed
      correct spelling (for example, you might have a Country column with an entry that says "Unted States of America".)
      There are hundreds of other things you could fix depending on the issues, so don't worry about whether or not your fix "counts" for the check. It           most likely will if you're fixing something.
  Commit your changes.
  Push your changes to GitHub, and make sure to turn in the GitHub link into Google Classroom.
