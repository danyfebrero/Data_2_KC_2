# This is my second Knowledge Check of Code Louisville!

## First Assignment:
For this assigment im going to clean some data. I would guess about 70% of data science is cleaning and wrangling data, so we want to make sure I can do it. I haven't looked through this data set at all, so we'll see if we can find some issues to clean up. 

## Instructions:
To complete the knowledge check, I will do the following:

Make a .py (or .ipynb) file that contains the following (your choice of editor does not matter!) and do the following:
* Find and access a data set. (API, a CSV, anything)
* Fix TWO issues with the data set using techniques learned in class.
* Commit changes.
* Push changes to GitHub, and turn in the GitHub link into Google Classroom.


### Here are some common fixes:
* Remove null values
* Fill in null values with 0's or blanks
* Fill in blanks
* Fix character strings that aren't formatted correctly (you could use regex for this)
* Correct column names if they're misnamed
* Correct spelling (for example, you might have a Country column with an entry that says "Unted States of America".)
* There are hundreds of other things you could fix depending on the issues, so don't worry about whether or not your fix "counts" for the check. It           most likely will if you're fixing something.
